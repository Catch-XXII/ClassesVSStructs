//: Classes are  "Reference Type" and their reference are stored inside the "heap" section of memory
//: Copying a reference, implicitly creates a shared instance. After a copy, two variables then refer to a single instance of the data, so modifying data in the second variable also affects the original.
//: Memory management should be handled manually with allocationg and deallocating in low level programming languages such as c and c++
//: Classes are blueprint of an object
//: Heap for dynamic memory allocation
//: ARC does the job in apple devices. Reference count is tracked by the ARC and when it becomes zero, the object is deallocated.
